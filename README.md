## Assignment
When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, the site prompts the user for the necessary criteria and builds the password accordingly. They can select the length of the password between 8 and 128 characters and can choose to include upper case characters, lower case characters, numbers, and/or symbols.

This password generator was created using JavaScript to meet the following criteria:

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
